# Feature Engineering

This repository contains a collection of hacks and tips for feature engineering. It is a great resource for anyone who wants to learn how to improve the performance of their machine learning models.

Feature selection and feature engineering are two important steps in machine learning. Feature selection is the process of identifying the most important features to include in a model, while feature engineering is the process of creating new features from existing ones.

Scikit-learn is a popular machine learning library in Python that provides a number of tools for feature selection and feature engineering. The following are some of the most commonly used methods:

Recursive feature elimination (RFE): This method starts with all of the features and then iteratively removes the least important features until a specified number of features remain.
Forward feature selection (FFS): This method starts with no features and then iteratively adds the most important features until a specified number of features are included.
Chi-squared test: This test is used to measure the association between a feature and the target variable. Features with a high chi-squared value are considered to be important.
F-score: This score is used to measure the importance of a feature by taking into account both its correlation with the target variable and its variance. Features with a high F-score are considered to be important.
Once you have selected a feature selection method, you can use it to select the features to include in your model. Scikit-learn provides a number of tools for feature engineering, including:

Polynomial features: These features are created by taking the powers of existing features. For example, if you have a feature called "age", you could create a polynomial feature called "age^2".
Interaction features: These features are created by taking the products of existing features. For example, if you have features called "age" and "gender", you could create an interaction feature called "age*gender".
Time series features: These features are created by taking the values of a feature over time. For example, if you have a feature called "sales", you could create a time series feature called "sales_last_week".
Once you have engineered the features, you can use them to train your model. Scikit-learn provides a number of tools for model training, including:

Linear regression: This is a simple model that can be used to predict a continuous target variable.
Logistic regression: This is a model that can be used to predict a binary target variable.
Decision trees: These are models that can be used to predict both continuous and binary target variables.
Random forests: These are models that are similar to decision trees, but they are more robust to overfitting.
Once you have trained your model, you can evaluate its performance. Scikit-learn provides a number of tools for model evaluation, including:

Accuracy: This is the percentage of instances that the model correctly predicts.
Precision: This is the percentage of instances that the model predicts as positive that are actually positive.
Recall: This is the percentage of instances that are actually positive that the model predicts as positive.
F1 score: This is a measure of the model's overall performance. It is calculated as the harmonic mean of the precision and recall.
Feature selection and feature engineering are important steps in machine learning. By selecting the right features and engineering them correctly, you can improve the performance of your model.


### What is feature engineering?
Feature engineering is the process of creating new features from existing ones. This can be done by combining existing features, transforming them in some way, or creating completely new features. The goal of feature engineering is to create features that are more predictive of the target variable than the original features.

### Why is feature engineering important?
Feature engineering is important because it can improve the performance of machine learning models. By creating features that are more predictive of the target variable, you can make your models more accurate and reliable.
